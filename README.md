checkers
========

A Checkers game using Python Tkinter. The pieces on the board are placed vertically to better facilitate two-player mode. 


**Tasks done so far:**
1. Created the 2-player Checkers GUI with TKinter
2. Developed all the basic moves that players can make in Checkers
3. Ironed out a ton of functionality-based syntax and semantic errors.

**Tasks TODO:**
1. There are a few glitches that were found when making certain moves in the game - these need to be ironed out.
2. Create a welcome screen before players get to play.
3. For future: give player ability to exit game and start a new one at any time.
4. For future: players can enter personalized usernames; these can be displayed during play as well.
